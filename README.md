[satopian/poti-kaini: お絵かき掲示板PHPスクリプトPOTI-board改二, for PHP7 (PHP5.5～, 7.x, 8.0)](https://github.com/satopian/poti-kaini)  
存儲庫管理員依靠Google翻譯，因為它只懂日語.  
### Overview of required work.
`template_ini.php` has language resources for messages such as error messages and successful image uploads.  
There is also Japanese to translate in the `template HTML file`.  
We also need to translate the body of `search.php` and` search.html`.  
However, POTI-board.php externalizes all language settings, so no changes are needed.  
Translation of config.php requires translation of the descriptive text for the end user to set.    

### [2021/04/28]  
開始翻譯. 
Translated the const in template_ini.php.  
Some translations remain in English or Japanese.  
This is because the translation of that part did not go well.  
I would like help from those who understand Chinese.  
- template_ini.php 
- I translated template_ini.php.  
This is an incomplete translation.  
Please pull request and fix this.
